# Ethics Final Project: Ethicacy of Recommendation Algorithms and Curated Social Media Feeds

## Participant Names
Tiffany Wong and Emma Wingreen

## Description
It is well known that various social media platforms track user actions and use it to customize user experience.
While curated newsfeeds and recommended activity to interact with has the short-term effect of boosting user
engagement, its long-term effects also need to be studied as people grow more addicted to social media.

## Programming Component
We intend to incorporate a recommendation algorithm and the user data it takes in to understand how it generates
recommendations. https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/01/26/instagram-algorithm-with-machine-learning/ published an
example of Instagram's recommendation algorithm with machine learning using Python. The sample algorithm provides
a raw dataset that uses data like followers, hashtags, time since posted, and likes.

We will look into Instagram's Terms of Service and, if necessary, include more input data. We will continue to
conduct research on recommendation algorithms published online.

## Potential Solutions
- Browsing your own social media in “incognito mode” or "do not track" mode
- Ability to turn off infinite feed (see previous iterations of Instagram, Facebook when the user was able to
  catch up in their feed to the last post they viewed before)
- Different newsfeeds - by time, by preference, by person, by mutual connections
